## Wine Type Prediction in Italy

### Overview

This project was undertaken during my training at NTI, where I aimed to analyze and model a wine dataset from Italy. The project involved defining the problem, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing the data, and applying a Gaussian Distribution model to predict wine types.

### Dataset

The dataset used is a well-known dataset for wine classification, containing chemical properties of various wines. You can find the dataset ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data ) (replace with the actual link if different).

### Project Steps

#### 1. Define the Problem
The main objective was to predict the type of wine based on its chemical properties such as acidity, sugar content, pH, alcohol content, and more.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and explore relationships between different variables. Visualizations and summary statistics were used to gain insights.

#### 3. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables (if any)
- Scaling numerical features
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

#### 4. Gaussian Distribution Model
A Gaussian Distribution model was chosen to classify the wine types. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the model.
